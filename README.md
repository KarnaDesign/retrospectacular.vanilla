# Retrospectacular.vanilla

Retrospectacular.vanilla is a small demo project using, no surprise, vanilla javascript.
It is what it is, a spectacular retrospect board.

## How can I convince my PM that we should use this at work?

You shouldn't. You really shouldn't. This is just a demo to refresh my vanilla js knowledge, nothing else.
